        <p> My name is Ashley Clark. I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with a Bachelor's of Arts
        degree in Communication Science and a Doctorate in Audiology from Kent State University. I have worked as an Audiologist for the past 5 years. I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I have a brother named Brandon
        and my parents are Eric and Debra. My whole family was born in Cleveland, except for my brother who was born in Atlanta.
        My favorite color is purple, my favorite food are sweet potatoes and peanut butter. I am excited to learn how to code!.

            I started my career at the Johnson City VAMC, where I worked as a fourth year extern as well as a fulltime Audiologist. I moved to the Houston VAMC
            a few years later, and in 2016, I decided to leave government healthcare and begin working in private practice. I have been in practive practice since 2017.
            It is a little overwhelming to start a new career at 31 years of age, especially since I went to school for so long for Audiology. However,
            evenything is going well so far and I am still excited about coding.
